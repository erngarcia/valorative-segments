# Valorative Segment Tagging with Neural Sequence Models

This repository supports the experiments described in our SEPLN 2024 paper on automatic appraisal detection in YouTube comments using BiLSTM-based models. We focus on the attitude domain of **Appraisal Theory** (Martin & White, 2005), with a special emphasis on the **affect**, **judgement**, and **appreciation** subcategories.

---

## 🧠 Task Overview
The task is formulated as a **sequence labeling problem** where each token in a YouTube comment is tagged as part of a valorative segment (B-, I-) or background (O). Labels correspond to appraisal types: `B-judgement`, `I-affect`, etc.

We evaluate several neural architectures:
- **BiLSTM**
- **BiLSTM + CRF**
- **BiLSTM + Attention**

## 🚀 Running a Single Experiment

```bash
python main.py
```

To run a programmatic experiment (for sweep or script usage):
```python
from main import run_experiment
hparams = {
    "lr": 1e-4,
    "batch_size": 32,
    "hidden_dim": 192,
    "dropout": 0.3,
    "model_type": "BiLSTM"
}
run_experiment(hparams, experiment_number=1)
```

---

## 🔁 Running Multiple Experiments

```bash
python sweep_experiments.py
```

You can customize the hyperparameter search space in `sweep_experiments.py`.

---

## 🧪 Metrics Logged
After each validation step:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Accuracy

Metrics are saved to `results/experiments_log.csv` along with:
- Timestamp
- Model type
- Hyperparameters
